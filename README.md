# About the project

I recently followed a tutorial that made a calcualtor using React and I wanted to do the same thing with Vanilla JavaScript.

This walkthrough was completed with the aid of the Web Dev Simplified YouTube channel.

The fully function calcualtor has some aesthetic touches and functions well with good UX features such as commas when the numbers get larger but not if a decimal is added.

This small project enbaled me to work more with the concepts of Class, using the 'this.' operation, adding event listeners and utilizing 'document.quereySelector'.


## Opening the Calculator

To open this project, clone the git and then open the index.html file with Google Chrome. The calcuator will be functional in the browser at this point.
